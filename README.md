# DEVmates

## What is DEVmates?
DEVmates is a mentorship program for CS/CIS/SE/EE students at the California State University San Marcos. DEVmates aims to provide students with the chance to learn from one another, create supportive relationships, and strengthen the tech community @ CSUSM

This Repository is a directory of tutorials and examples that I have created in order to teach my Devmates mentees new skills and technologies.

As a mentor, I plan on teaching my mentees more about different programming languages, web development, and app development.

### Intro To Python
- Workshop dedicated to teach the fundamentals of the Python programming languages

### Intro To API In Python
- Workshop to teach mentees how to make API requests in Python
- Utilized the OpenWeatherMap API to find weather in various cities

### Intro To Flask
- Workshop dedicated to teach the web framework Flask
- Meant to teach mentees how to take data from the front-end to the back-end
- A simple degree converter that converts Celcius to Fahrenheit and vice versa
- Teaches the basics of HTML
- Also taught how to push code into a Repository through Git

### Weather Website With Flask
- Website that teaches mentees how to combine the OpenWeatherMap API and the Flask framework
- Mentees will develop a website that allows users to search up the weather in any city
